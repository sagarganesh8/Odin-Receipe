    <p> Pizza is one of the most sought-after dishes of Italian cuisine and is one of the easy dishes that you can prepare at home 
        for your loved ones. The only setback is - making the perfect pizza base. Not everyone can make it. However, in this easy recipe, 
        we give you step-by-step details on how to make a pizza using the fresh pizza base. 
        Though you can buy a pizza base from the nearest superstore or market, the real taste of a pizza will only come when you make a 
        fresh pizza.
